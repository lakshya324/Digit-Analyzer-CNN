# Document Scanner and Translator Model

## Introduction

Hello, I'm Lakshya Sharma, a student currently pursuing a B.Tech degree in Computer Science and Information Technology at AKGEC, Ghaziabad. In this documentation, I aim to simplify and clarify the information about the Document Scanner and Translator Model I've been working on. My goal is to make it easy for you to understand and save your valuable time.

### What Drives Me

I decided to embark on this project for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I believe it's a challenging topic, especially for first-year students like me, but I also recognize its practical applications. Initially, I developed this model to recognize digits. However, by expanding its capabilities to include alphabets and training it on a substantial dataset, I envision it becoming a powerful tool for various tasks.

One exciting prospect is connecting this model with a robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) model. By doing so, it could assist in:
- Scanning documents from images.
- Translating scanned documents.
- Summarizing scanned documents.
- Evaluating the significance of scanned documents.

I must admit that my current knowledge of machine learning is somewhat limited, and I'm actively seeking guidance to bridge the gap and effectively develop this model.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Document Scanner and Translator Model, follow these simple steps:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your computer:
   - Python
   - Required Python libraries (such as TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Tkinter)
   - Jupyter Notebook (for development and experimentation)

2. **Installation**: Clone the project repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git
   ```

3. **Usage**: Navigate to the project directory and refer to the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for using the model. You can utilize the model for tasks like document scanning, translation, and summarization.
